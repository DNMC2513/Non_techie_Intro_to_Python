    "- In Python, branching is the process of automatically determining which code blocks to execute based on conditions represented in the statements to which they belong.\n",
    "- The code progresses in the same logical direction as the statement whose condition is satisfied.\n",
    "- Branching refers to the metaphor in which the logical flow of the code is the chunk of the tree, and the logical flows of statements are branches since they all take root from the same point and diverge from each other.\n",
    "- The branching paradigm looks like this:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if <condition1>:\n",
    "    <statement_1a>\n",
    "    <statement_1b>\n",
    "    <statement_1..>\n",
    "elif <condition2>:\n",
    "    <statement_2a>\n",
    "    <statement_2b>\n",
    "    <statement_2..>\n",
    "elif <condition_3>:\n",
    "    <statement3_a>\n",
    "    <statement3_b>\n",
    "    <statement3_..>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <statement4_a>\n",
    "    <statement4_b>\n",
    "    <statement4_..>\n",
    "```    \n",
    "- A branching block can only include one `if` and `else` statement. However, it is possible for us to have as many `elif` statements as possible.\n",
    "- All conditions represented by `if` and `elif` statements must be mutually exclusive.\n",
    "- The condition represented by `else` statements are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive with stated conditions."

    "    - Otherwise, the code block will be skipped if the condition statement is not satisfied. Next, Python will move on to the next condition statement and iterate the Phrase1 over and over again until one condition statement is satisfied, then move to Phrase2."
